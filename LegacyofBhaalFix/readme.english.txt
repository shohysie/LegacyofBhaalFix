Fixing Saving throws BUG for Lecgacy of Bhaal difficulty

Fixing BUG for Lecgacy of Bhaal difficulty that Saving throws adjusted to 20.
This MOD modifies the scripts of most creatures, allowing them to modify their own Saving throws as they appear.

Component 1: Saves of creatures is fixed to the original Saving throws plus 5, which will take effect only in LOB difficulty.
This is realized by creatures' scripts, it may not work on a small number of creatures without scripts, but these creatures generally do not participate in combat.

Component 2:  Reducing the enhancement (HP, AC, THAC0, Saving throws, but not level) received by low-level creatures in LOB mode, it increases step by step as level of creatures increase. Only creatures above level 25 (originally level 13 in no LOB games) receive complete enhancement.
For example, HP of a level 13 creature (originally level 1 in no LOB games) generally does not exceed 40 after adjustment, and the HP of a level 17 creature (originally level 5 in no LOB games) generally does not exceed 130.

Familiars as well as summoned creatures on both sides will also be adjusted in the same way.
Those amendment excludes all members who can join the party. There may be a small number of misjudgments but not serious.
